<h2>2.0 Pre-Exercise: Install Python and Django</h2>
<p>
  This courses uses Python 3 and Django 2.1 as a web development framework.
  Django is delivered as a Python library.
</p>
<p>
  First, make sure you have Python 3. Check
  <a href="../03_python/instructions.html#functions">Python installation instructions</a> in Round 3.
  Alternatively <code>python3</code> is ready for use in Aalto IT Linux and Niksula machines.
  Next, you need to install Django library.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger">
  <strong>On Windows</strong>, you can install Django globally.
	Depending where you installed Python you may have to search
	<code>cmd</code> and right click to <code>Run as Administrator</code>.
  <pre class="terminal">
$ <strong>pip install django</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>On Linux or OS X</strong>, you should probably install Django in
  an isolated virtualenv. This way Python version and libraries
  can be activated and deactivated when other versions are required.
  <pre class="terminal">
$ <strong>virtualenv -p python3 ~/djangoenv</strong>
$ <strong>source ~/djangoenv/bin/activate</strong>
$ <strong>pip install django</strong></pre>
  <strong>The source command has to be run whenever you open a new terminal</strong>
		and want to work with Django:
	<pre class="terminal">
$ <strong>source ~/djangoenv/bin/activate</strong></pre>
  You can type <kbd>deactivate</kbd> to exit the environment.
</div>

<p class="alert alert-warning" id="virtualenv">
  Some python installations may require <code>easy_install pip</code>
  and <code>pip install virtualenv</code> before running the above commands.
</p>

<p>
That is it, you are now ready for the Exercise. If you have trouble with
the Django installation come to the exercise session and/or make
questions in Piazza.
</p>

<h1>2. First Django project</h1>

<p>Now you should have Django installed. In this first part of the exercise, we
will create a new Django project (site) to the exercise directory, install an existing
application in it, set up an sqlite database and run the Django
development server locally.
</p>

<p>(2.1) To create a new Django project in the exercise directory.
	Open a terminal (On Windows Git BASH supports following syntax) and type:</p>
<pre>
$ <strong>cd wsd2019/exercises/05_django</strong>
$ <strong>django-admin.py startproject firstdjango</strong>
</pre>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/django-admin/" target="_blank">django-admin.py</a>
	is an administrative tool for Django.

<p>
(2.2) Next, you need to move an existing application directory <code>webshop</code>
to inside the newly created <code>firstdjango</code> directory. You can do this
and stage the change for a commit at the same time by typing:
</p>
<pre>
$ <strong>git mv webshop firstdjango/</strong>
</pre>
<p>
Edit the project settings <code>firstdjango/firstdjango/settings.py</code>.
Add webshop to installed apps and study the other default
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/" target="_blank">settings</a>.
</p>

<p>(2.3) Next, you can create the tables to your database using the
	<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/django-admin/" target="_blank">manage.py</a>
	script.</p>
<pre>
$ <strong>cd firstdjango</strong>
$ <strong>python manage.py makemigrations webshop</strong>
Migrations for 'webshop':
  0001_initial.py:
    - Create model Product
$ <strong>python manage.py migrate</strong>
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, webshop, contenttypes, auth, sessions
Running migrations:
...
</pre>

<p>(2.4) Now edit the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/http/urls/" target="_blank">main routing</a>
	 in <code>firstdjango/firstdjango/urls.py</code> to contain the following routings:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>/about/</code> should render view <code>webshop.views.about</code></li>
<li><code>/products/</code> should render view <code>webshop.views.available_products</code></li>
<li><code>/products/some~number~here/</code> should render view <code>webshop.views.productview</code> with non-named integer parameter to the view. (an example URL "/products/523/")</li>
</ol>

<p class="alert alert-info">
In general, it would be better to have a separate urls.py inside the
webshop app and include this in the main urls.py. However, in this
exercise you are asked to write the url routings directly to the main
urls.py (created when the project was created).
</p>

<p>Finally, it is time to test the site.</p>
<pre>
$ <strong>python manage.py runserver</strong>
</pre>

<p>Direct your browser e.g. to <a href="http://localhost:8000/about/">http://localhost:8000/about</a>
	and try out the URLs you added. Notice that the <a href="http://localhost:8000/">server root</a>
	should give <code>404 Page not found</code> at this moment. This is because the root path
	does not match any defined URL routes. You can stop
	the test server with <kbd>ctrl-c</kbd> in the terminal.
</p>

<p>The webshop application includes some unit tests. It is a good
idea to run these before submitting.</p>
<pre>
$ <strong>python manage.py test webshop</strong>
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
.s.ssss.sss
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 11 tests in 0.027s

OK (skipped=8)
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
</pre>

<p class="alert alert-info">
For a full list of Django management actions run <code>python manage.py</code>
without adding an action name to the end.
</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Project to A+</h3>
<p>Add, commit and push your new files and possible changes to the Git as in round 1.
Finally, just copy and paste your GitLab project's URL to A+. The file we will check is
<code>exercises/05_django/firstdjango/firstdjango/urls.py</code>.
Remember that you can submit this exercise only 10 times. Grading is either all
or nothing. Test your urls before submitting.</p>
</div>

<div class="content" id="models">
<h1>3. Models</h1>

<p>In this exercise your job is to write the required model for our sample Django
	 application "webshop". A skeleton for the model is already provided by the
	 exercise template - your job is to add the properly configured fields and some
	  methods to the <code>Product</code> class.</p>

<h4>Fields</h4>
<table class="separated table">
	<thead><tr><th>field name</th><th>requirements</th></tr></thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr><td>title</td><td>string of maximum of 255 characters, needs to be unique</td></tr>
	<tr><td>description</td><td>unlimited text</td></tr>
	<tr><td>image_url</td><td>a <strong>URL</strong> of an image of the product. The value should be optional.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>quantity</td><td>number of items in stock (default to 0)</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Django will automatically add a field <code>id</code> for the primary key so
	you don't have to worry about this.</p>

<h4>Methods</h4>
<ul>
	<li><code>sell()</code>, method that should decrease the quantity of the product
		by one. Remember that in Python methods need to be given <code>self</code> as
		the first parameter in the definition.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Additional study material</h4>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/fields/" target="_blank">Django Model Field Reference</a></li>
</ul>

<h4>Typical Mistakes</h4>
<ul>
	<li>forgetting to save() after making changes</li>
	<li>forgetting the self-parameter when defining methods</li>
	<li>forgetting to use self when referencing instance variables</li>
</ul>

<p class="alert alert-info">
Students familar with concurrency issues in database systems may recognize the
potential for a race condition in the way that the <code>sell()</code> method
updates the <code>quantity</code> field. While this is not an issue in this
exercise when limited to single concurrent request, you should note that Django
provides mechanisms such as
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/transactions/" target="_blank">database transactions</a> or more specialized
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/models/instances/#updating-attributes-based-on-existing-fields" target="_blank">update expressions</a>
which would be required in an implementation of <code>sell()</code> designed
to handle multiple concurrent requests.
</p>

<h3>How to Test Your Models</h3>
<p>
First of all, before you can use your models in Django, you need to
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/migrations/" target="_blank">migrate</a>
the model changes to your database schema. If you closed the terminal you
will have to open it up and <kbd>cd</kbd> to your working directory. On Linux
or OS X, also remember to activate your Django virtual environment as in the
beginning of this round.
</p>
<pre>
$ <strong>python manage.py makemigrations webshop</strong>
You are trying to add a non-nullable field 'title' to product without a default; we can't do that (the database needs something to populate existing rows).
Please select a fix:
 1) Provide a one-off default now (will be set on all existing rows)
 2) Quit, and let me add a default in models.py
Select an option: <strong>1</strong>
Please enter the default value now, as valid Python
The datetime and django.utils.timezone modules are available, so you can do e.g. timezone.now()
&gt;&gt;&gt; <strong>''</strong>
$ <strong>python manage.py migrate</strong>
</pre>
<p>
<strong>The <kbd>makemigrations</kbd> and <kbd>migrate</kbd> need to be done every
time after the models have been changed!</strong>
When the database schema is not sufficient to determine the migration process
the makemigrations asks you questions as above.
The idea of making and storing database migration steps is that they can be applied
to any live services during version upgrades and downgrades. They take care of
both changing the database schema and <strong>existing records</strong>.
</p>

<p>
To play around with your models, use the manage.py's shell
command. This is a fully functional python interpreter with some
special environment variables set. But before you can access any of
your models and views, you need to import them:</p>

<pre>
$ <strong>python manage.py shell</strong>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <strong>from webshop.models import Product</strong>
</pre>
<p>Now try to create an instance of the model you just created:</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <strong>p = Product(title="Teddy Bear", description="Huge fluffy teddy-bear", quantity=10)</strong>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <strong>print(p.title)</strong>
</pre>
<p>Notice that you can already use the object (just like Python object)
even though it is not saved in the database yet. Try:</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <strong>print(p.pk)</strong>
</pre>
<p>There's nothing there. But after you save it, the object has a pk (id) assigned by the database:</p>
<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <strong>p.save()</strong>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <strong>print(p.pk)</strong>
</pre>

<p>
Other things to try out in the shell:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Fetch a specific saved model from the database by its title.</li>
	<li>Test your sell() method. Test that it actually saves the decreased quantity to the database.</li>
	<li>Create some Products, save them, fetch them from the database, for-loop over them and print their titles.</li>
	<li>Create few Products with quantity of 0 and few with quantity of &gt; 0 and save them to database. Make a query that returns a QuerySet with only those Products that have quantity &gt; 0.</li>
	<li>Try using the delete() method to remove a Product from the database.</li>
</ul>

<p class="alert alert-info">
A quick way to reset test objects from the database is to delete the file
<code>db.sqlite3</code> and create a new database using the <code>migrate</code>
command. However, this does not remove any migrations steps built with
<code>makemigrations</code> into the <code>webshop/migrations</code> directory.
</p>

<p>Remember that you can submit this exercise only 10 times. Grading
is either all or nothing. Test your models before submitting. Some unit tests are
provided also for exercise 3 but they are currently skipped. In the <code>webshop/tests.py</code>
remove lines <code>@unittest.skip("Exercise 3")</code> and run the tests again.
While doind so, you hopefully read some tests and perhaps even look into
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/testing/" target="_blank">Django testing documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Project to A+</h3>
<p>Add, commit and push your changes to the Git as in round 1.
Finally, just copy and paste your GitLab project's URL to A+.
The file we will check is <code>exercises/05_django/firstdjango/webshop/models.py</code>.</p>

</div>

<div class="content" id="views">
<h1>4. Views</h1>

<p>In this exercise your job is to write some required views for our sample Django application "webshop".
Use the models you created in the previous exercise.</p>

<h3>Views to implement</h3>

<h4>productview(request, product_id)</h4>

<p>This view should render a product description page
  for the given product_id. The template <code>product_view.html</code>
  is expecting a single parameter <code>product</code> in the context which refers to
  the <code>Product</code> model object with the given id.</p>

<p>Your job is to make the view retrieve the <code>Product</code> object from the database,
    use it to render the template and finally return an HttpResponse object that contains the resulting string.
    If the <code>Product</code> with the given <code>product_id</code> can not be found raise a 404 exception
    (or return HttpResponseNotFound)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The dummy implementation of the return statement is there for other exercises.
    Replace it with the required return statement.</p>

<pre class="brush: py">def productview(request, product_id):
  """
  Write your view implementations for exercise 4 here.
  Remove the current return line below.
  """
  return HttpResponse("product %s"%(product_id))</pre>

<h4>available_products(request)</h4>

<p>This view should render a page with a list of all available products. A
  product is available if it has a quantity that's bigger than 0.
  The template <code>product_list.html</code> is expecting
  a single parameter <code>products</code> in the context which refers to
  an iterable of <code>Product</code> objects.</p>

<p>Your job is to make the view retrieve the the available products, use them to render the template and
    return an HttpResponse object that contains the resulting string.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The dummy implementation of the return statement is there for other exercises.
    Replace it with the required return statement.</p>

<pre class="brush: python">def available_products(request):
  """
  Write your view implementations for exercise 4 here.
  Remove the current return line below.
  """
  return HttpResponse("View not implemented!")</pre>

<h4>Hints</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Test your code before sending it in. Use the Django's runserver and your browser
      and also run the provided unit tests skipped with <code>unittest.skip("Exercise 4")</code>
      and notice some tests for Exercise 2 will now fail and should be skipped.</li>
  <li>Don't forget to import methods/classes you use in your code.</li>
  <li>Django automatically generates an <code>id</code> field for every model (instance)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-to-read">Things to Read</h3>
<p>Here are some external resources to help you out with this exercise:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/http/views/" target="_blank">Writing Views</a></li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/db/queries/#retrieving-objects" target="_blank">Retrieving Objects</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>You may have noticed that Django displays a lot of debug information
in the browser when something goes wrong. When the site is published
the following in <code>settings.py</code> must be changed to
<code>DEBUG=False</code> and <code>ALLOWED_HOSTS=["*"]</code> (* if
the actual host domains are unknown). After this, Django will not display
debug messages in 404 or 500 pages.</p>
<p>You can change the default pages by adding <code>404.html</code> and
<code>500.html</code> to you project. This could be in the same place where
other templates - but because that template is often project, rather than
app, specific, you can also create a project specific templates directory
(e.g. next to your <code>webshop</code> app)
and place general templates there. Finally, you need to specify in Django settings for
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/settings/#templates" target="_blank" class="alert-link">TEMPLATES</a>
this new location in DIRS.</p>
